## Books

1. [Cybernetics 2.0](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-98140-2)

I became deeply interested in biological neural networks during my time at Stanford. I stumbled upon active research on the topic being performed by [Dr. Bernard Widrow](https://profiles.stanford.edu/bernard-widrow) during his course on Adaptive Signal processing. For three years, I partnered with him to develop neural networks with local learning rules inspired by homeostatic regulation. All ideas in the book originated from Dr. Widrow. I assisted him by running computer simulations, performing literature reviews, and ultimately transcribing his hand-written words into a book published by [Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-98140-2). The book provides novel ideas on algorithmic ways of achieving homeostasis in various sytems including human neurons that induce "learning", bloog glucose regulation, and even plant growth.
